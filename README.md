This portfolio project is a showcase of my skills and projects, featuring sections for Home, About Me,
Projects, Blogs, Contact Me, and an Admin Panel for project and blog management. Built using HTML, and CSS, 
the portfolio is designed to be responsive and user-friendly, allowing visitors to explore my work, 
read my blogs, and contact me easily. The Admin Panel enables efficient management of projects and blogs, providing functionalities for adding,
editing, and removing content. I welcome contributions and feedback to improve this portfolio further.
